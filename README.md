# Applied Deep Learning - Winter term 2019/2020

## Part1 - Initiate

*In this exercise you will research the topic, you want to work on during this course and plan your
work. You should read scientific research, understand whatâ€™s currently possible and produce a
detailed plan of your next steps, including a time estimation for each step.* [Overview and Goals from lecture](./1_initiate/Exercise1-Initiate.pdf)

## Part2 - Hacking

*In this exercise, you will deep dive into your project, try to build a simple baseline model that
operates on your data as one would expect (although not necessarily in an ideal way). Then try to
optimize your neural network as much as you can (given your available time budget), i.e., perform
hyperparameter optimization and/or gather more data.* [Overview and Goals from lecture](./2_hacking/Exercise2-Hacking.pdf)

## Part3 - Deliver

*In this third and final exercise your task is to demonstrate what you have achieved in the previous
few months. You will do this in three different forms:
- Build a small demo application that runs your trained model and performs inference
- Write the final report of your project
- Prepare the presentation that you will give in class*
