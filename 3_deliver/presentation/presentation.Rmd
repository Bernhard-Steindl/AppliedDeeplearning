```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Initiate

Improve existing super resolution generative adversarial network.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="30%"}
myimages<-c('grumpy1.png', 'grumpy2.png', 'grumpy3.png')
knitr::include_graphics(myimages)
```

## Hacking

- Succeeded CPU training.

- Failed CUDA.

- Failed improving.

## Delivery

- Reused existing SR GAN.

- Implemented client/server app with Flask.

## Take-aways

- Still no idea how to invent complicated neural networks - need more practice.

- Can be hard to setup CUDA support on Azure VM.

- Use early stopping.

## Thank you for your attention!
